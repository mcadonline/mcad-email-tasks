        This class requires you to setup an MCAD account to access printing services. Please complete the following
        steps before your first day of class.
      </p>

      <h2>STEP 1: SETUP YOUR MCAD ACCOUNT</h2>

      <p>
        Please setup your MCAD account. You will need your username and student id number below. If you already have an
        MCAD account and know your password, you can skip this step.
      </p>

      <div class="info-box">
        <p class="key-value">
          <p class="key-value">
            <b class="key">Username</b>
            <code class="value">{{username}}</code>
          </p>
          <p class="key-value">
            <b class="key">Student ID#</b>
            <code class="value">{{id}}</code>
          </p>
      </div>

      <p><a class="button" href="https://password.mcad.edu/index.php?selfservice=forgotpw">Setup MCAD Account</a>
      </p>

      <p>Once you've filled out the form, you will receive a message at your personal email with a link to set (or
        reset) your password. Please save your new login information for future use during the semester.</p>

      <p><b>Having trouble?</b> Email <a href="mailto:help_desk@mcad.edu">help_desk@mcad.edu</a> if you are having
        difficulties setting up your MCAD account.</p>

      <h2>STEP 2: LEARN ABOUT PRINTING VIA PAPERCUT</h2>

      <p>Printing at the <a href="https://intranet.mcad.edu/department/service-bureau">MCAD Service Bureau</a> is
        managed through PaperCut, an online print payment system. Only students in approved classes, such as yours, may
        access this system and utilize the MCAD Service Bureau.</p>

      <p>
        Please review important information about accessing and using your PaperCut account <strong>before your class
          begins</strong>:

        <p>After your course ends, some things will happen that you should keep in mind:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>

          </li>
          <li>

            or use your
            Papercut account or the MCAD Service
            Bureau, and your corresponding Papercut account will be cleared of its value.
